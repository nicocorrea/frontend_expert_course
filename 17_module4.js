export function algoExpert2() {
  console.log("AlgoExpert is the best!");
}

export function frontendExpert2() {
  console.log("FrontendExpert is the best!");
}

/*
I can also do....

 export { algoExpert2 as algo, frontendExpert2 }



and I can also have a default expert, but don't recall how it works...

export default function algoExpert2() {
    console.log('AlgoExpert is the best!');
}
